My first language is Chinese, just so you guys know.

I'm extremely busy with my education now, so I have to give up some of my hobbies, I guess. D:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- Learning.(I mean, busy with my education)
- Trying to be a **PERFECT** good person.
- Learning Unity 3D(I have lots of good ideas on making different games!)
- Learning C#.(One of the best lang... No, the best language must be **Lisp**!)


ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

- Some problems with learning.
- Translating a game called [Buddy Simulator 1984](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1269950/Buddy_Simulator_1984/), we've only got 3 people in our localization team.
- Some psychological problems. Honestly, I just can't admit that I'm not so perfect. I don't want to be an antisocial guy. I don't know how to stop thinking about some violent things. Damn it.
